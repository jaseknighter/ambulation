# SuperCollider tutorials

This repo is designed to teach SuperCollider to beginners through two self-styled tutorials that I've designed. The theme of these workshops is *ambulation* - getting you to take your first steps to walk on your own with SuperCollider. Both are offered as workshops at [Music Hackspace](https://musichackspace.org/events/tone-to-drone-introduction-to-supercollider-for-monome-norns-live-session/) but all the materials are included here and can be used as a self-guided workshop as well.

What is SuperCollider? SuperCollider is a free platform for audio synthesis and algorithm composition. It really excels at real-time analysis, synthesis, sampling, and processing and provides a framework for seamless combination of audio techniques like additive and subtractive synthesis. 

What can you do with SuperCollider? Really, the sky is the limit. I've used SuperCollider to make [my own live-coding environment](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQCu9z3haBD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), [new synths](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJTwGz8hxMR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), [crazy drum beats](https://www.instagram.com/p/COqOS5lBGDL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
), [make drum sets](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPghuJUB2Of/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and I've barely scratched the surface.

The two workshops each have a primary goal. In workshop #1, the goal is to make [a drone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_music). In workshop #2, the goal is to make a sampler. In both workshops, SuperCollider will be taught in a way that incrementally builds your skills and understanding to reach these goals. Of course, SuperCollider is much deeper than either of these two goals, but you'll be able to use these workshops as a jumping off point to learn more about SuperCollider, for example, [in these other tutorials](https://supercollider.github.io/tutorials/).

### Note: this workshop is available as a video series at [Music Hackspace](https://musichackspace.org/events/tone-to-drone-introduction-to-supercollider-for-monome-norns-live-session/).

In this workshop we will start at the very beginning of SuperCollider, assuming you don't yet know anything about SuperCollider. 

We will start by learning how to make simple sounds, then modulating those sounds, and finally adding effects to them. We will go through all the basics of SuperCollider in a practical way, building up from a single tone all the way to making a [space drone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schollz/ambulation/main/droning/55hz_spacedrone.mp3)!

### Part 0: before you begin

[Install SuperCollider](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation#installing-supercollider) and then you are ready to start this workshop. 

### Part 1: how to make a sound

Open [part1.scd](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation/blob/main/droning/part1.scd) in SuperCollider.

This part will teach the basics of SuperCollider and making sounds. By the end of this part, you should be able to mix different sounds together and use additive synthesis to make tones and overtones.

### Part 2: how to modulate the sound

Open [part2.scd](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation/blob/main/droning/part2.scd) in SuperCollider.

This part will teach some SuperCollider tricks to do *modulation*, that is, dynamically change different parts of the sounds. By the end you will be able to modulate frequency and amplitude to get a neat dynamic sound.


### Part 3: how to sculpt the sound 

Open [part3.scd](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation/blob/main/droning/part3.scd) in SuperCollider.

This part will teach about using the non-tonal components of SuperCollider - envelopes, effects, and filters! We will use these in combination with the tones in part 1 and the modulation in part 2 to make a space drone.

### Part 4: how to manipulate sounds from norns

Turn on your norns device and open up [maiden](https://monome.org/docs/norns/maiden/) on your computer. Install the ambulation repository if you haven't already. In maiden type:

```
;install https://github.com/schollz/ambulation
```

Now refresh maiden. There is a new code repository in `code/ambulation`. We will edit two files: `droning.lua` and `lib/Engine_Droning.sc`. Start with `lib/Engine_Droning.sc`. Try adding your own engine to it and then run `droning.lua`. Open `droning.lua` to understand better how it works.

### Bonus: hands-free drone harp

As a little bonus, you can use your drone and [control it with your hands](https://vimeo.com/567293081)! To get started with this, first [download the latest release of airsynth](https://github.com/schollz/airsynth/releases/latest). Then unzip that file and run it - it should open a browser that can detect your hands with your camera. Then open an run [bonus.scd](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation/blob/main/droning/bonus.scd). Use your new SuperCollider knowledge to change it to your own drone!

## Workshop 2: ample samples

### Note: this workshop is available as a video series at [Music Hackspace](https://musichackspace.org/events/ample-samples-introduction-to-supercollider-for-monome-norns-live-session/).

In this workshop we will start at the very beginning of SuperCollider. I will assume you don't now anything about SuperCollider. 

We will start by learning how to load a buffer, and then play the buffer with a simple player. We will learn how to add effects to the sound and the sample playback and eventually work our way towards a really efficient sampler that can be placed [into the norns](https://vimeo.com/user126081217).

### Part 0: before you begin

[Install SuperCollider](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation#installing-supercollider) and then you are ready to start this workshop. 

### Part 1: basics

Open [part1.scd](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation/blob/main/sampling/part1.scd) in SuperCollider.


This part will teach the basics of SuperCollider and making sounds. By the end of this part, you should be able to mix different sounds together and use additive synthesis to make tones and overtones.

### Part 2: using samples + fx

Open [part2.scd](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation/blob/main/sampling/part2.scd) in SuperCollider.


This part will teach how to load and play buffers. At the end of this tutorial, different types of effects will be explored.

### Part 3: an efficient sampler

Open [part3.scd](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation/blob/main/sampling/part3.scd) in SuperCollider.

This part will teach some SuperCollider tricks to develop a sophisticated sample playback engine. We will iterate on the sample playback synth created in part 2.

### Part 4: how to manipulate sounds from norns

Turn on your norns device and open up [maiden](https://monome.org/docs/norns/maiden/) on your computer. Install the ambulation repository if you haven't already. In maiden type:

```
;install https://github.com/schollz/ambulation
```

Now refresh maiden. There is a new code repository in `code/ambulation`. We will edit two files: `sampling.lua` and `sampling/Engine_Sampling.sc`. Start with `sampling/Engine_Sampling.sc`. Try adding your own fx to it and then run `sampling.lua`. Try changing the key 2 or key 3 to activate your sample [in these lines of code](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation/blob/main/sampling.lua#L114-L120).

## Installing SuperCollider

### Downloading SuperCollider

<details><summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

[Click here](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/releases/download/Version-3.11.2/SuperCollider-3.11.2-Windows-32bit-VS.exe) to download the latest Windows release. This is the *32-bit* release, rather than the 64-bit release, because [the most recent Windows Update prevents the 64-bit version from starting](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4368#issuecomment-832050665). But 32-bit will work just fine!

Then [click here](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins/releases/download/Version-3.11.1/sc3-plugins-3.11.1-Windows-32bit-VS.zip) to download the 32-bit sc3-plugins. Unzip these plugins and then copy and paste the `SC3plugins` folder into the following folder:

```
C:\Users\<yourname>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\Extensions\
```

Finally, I recommend you install a special SuperCollider package called "Safety" that will automatically prevent loud noises that can be caused by mistakes in coding. To install, [click here](https://github.com/adcxyz/SafetyNet/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the "SafetyNet" SuperCollider quark. Then unzip that downloaded file and move the folder to the following location:

```
C:\Users\<yourname>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\downloaded-quarks
```

After moving the folder, rename the folder `SafetyNet-main` so it says simply "SafetyNet".

Now start up SuperCollider and type into the main screen:

```
Quarks.install("SafetyNet")
```

Then goto `Language -> Evaluate File`. You should see some output that says "Installing SafetyNet / SafetyNet installed." To test to make sure its working you can do `Server -> Boot Server` and you should see something like:

```
Safety('localhost') is running, using 'safeClip_2'.
```

This will run automatically and will serve to automatically limit problematic sounds.

### Testing SuperCollider

Once you install SuperCollider, you can test that it works with the following steps to play a simple tone.

1. Open SuperCollider
2. Copy-and paste this into the main window: 

```
{ [SinOsc.ar(440, 0, 0.2), SinOsc.ar(442, 0, 0.2)] }.play;
```

3. Goto `Server` -> `Boot Server`

4. Goto `Language` -> `Evaluate File`

5. You should hear a sound - you are all set. If you do not hear a sound, please let me know via the Music Hackspace discord (https://discord.gg/RQERWTAk) or via the lines forum (https://llllllll.co/t/supercollider-norns-workshops-july-11th-and-july-25th) and I'll help you troubleshoot!

## Sharing SuperCollider over Zoom

<details><summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

Click the "Share Screen" button, select the SuperCollider window, and then below click on the carrot symbol next to "Share sound" to select "Stereo (High-fidelity)".

![Screen+Shot+2021-06-13+at+10.25.26+AM.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6550035/121835422-20a06a80-cc86-11eb-902a-1cd13f741b8c.png)

That's it! There shouldn't be any other steps to share your SuperCollider audio over Zoom on Windows.

<details><summary><strong>Mac OS</strong></summary>

Click the "Share Screen" button, select the SuperCollider window, and then below click on the carrot symbol next to "Share sound" to select "Stereo (High-fidelity)".

![Screen+Shot+2021-06-13+at+10.25.26+AM.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6550035/121835422-20a06a80-cc86-11eb-902a-1cd13f741b8c.png)


In Mac OS it seems there is an extra step to share audio in Zoom. Once you are sharing your screen, you need to restart the SuperCollider audio server to use the Zoom playback. Simply run this line of code and then restart your synthdefs:

```
// run this line *after* you start sharing
s.options.outDevice = "ZoomAudioD"; s.options.inDevice = "ZoomAudioD"; s.reboot;
```

Once you are done sharing, you can run this line of code to get your default output and input back:

```
// run this line when *not* sharing
s.options.outDevice = "Built-in Output"; s.options.inDevice = "Built-in Input"; s.reboot;
```
